All data processing pipelines were executed with megconnectome version 3.0. For some subjects that were included in earlier releases, the intermediate results from the manual processing steps that had already been performed with earlier versions of the data processing pipelines (manual coregistration of anatomy, manual detection of bad channels and segments) were retained. All results from the automatic steps were recomputed with version 3.0.


These data were generated and made available by the Human Connectome Project, WU-Minn Consortium (Principal Investigators: David Van Essen and Kamil Ugurbil; 1U54MH091657), which is funded by the 16 NIH Institutes and Centers that support the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research and by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University.
